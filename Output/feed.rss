The web applications are both deployed to a Linode server.</p><p>Docker 18.09 came with a new tool called BuildKit which allows you to export executables built inside a container so that they can be deployed directly on the target platform.</p><pre><code>DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --output type=tar,dest=release.tar .
</code></pre><p>By setting the DOCKER_BUILDKIT variable, we can output a tarfile containing the build artifacts we need, such as executables or compiled code.</p><p>In order to do this, we need to create a Dockerfile with a multi-stage (two stages) build. The first stage will install any dependencies and run the build. The second stage copies our build files into a clean container so that we can export just the build files that we need, rather than the whole codebase.</p><pre><code>FROM swift:xenial AS build-stage
WORKDIR /root
COPY . .
RUN apt-get -qq update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -yq libssl-dev libicu-dev
RUN swift build -c release

FROM scratch AS export-stage
# Vapor Swift stores build files in .build/release
COPY --from=build-stage /root/.build/release /

Transport for London provides a free-to-use Open API (https://api.tfl.gov.uk) we can easily utilise that will allow us to get up-to-date status for all its services.</p><p>Sample code for the project is available on GitHub:</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><h3>Requirements</h3><p>Developing for iOS 14 requires Xcode 12. Xcode 12 will run on any Mac which is running either macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or macOS 11.0 (Big Sur). You can download it from the beta software tab on the Apple Developer Downloads page: https://developer.apple.com/download/</p><p>You can run widgets in the simulator, but to take full advantage of this tutorial, including supporting multiple widgets and intents it’s best to have a device running iOS 14 or later.</p><h3>Project Setup</h3><p><em>Widgets cannot be provided standalone, so we will need to start with a boilerplate app. Here we will setup a new Xcode project and produce a basic app. If you are a seasoned app developer, you may want to skip to the “Your First Widget” section.</em></p><p>In order to get started, let’s select “Create a new Xcode project” from the Xcode launch screen. Select app, then next.</p><p>// image here: caption: Xcode 12 Launch window</p><p>WidgetKit requires “SwiftUI” as the interface so we will use this for our app too. <em> Enter a name for your project </em> Enter your own name, or company name under “Organization Identifier”. <em> Select “SwiftUI” to use for the “Interface” </em> Use “SwiftUI App” as the Lifecycle * Use “Swift” as the language.</p><p>This article won’t go into detail about how to test your app, but feel free to leave the “Include Tests” box checked.</p><p>Then, finally, choose a location to store your app on your Mac. Xcode will generate an app template containing <code>YourProjectApp.swift</code>.</p><h3>Architecture</h3><p>In order to share code between the main-app and widget, we can create a shared framework in Xcode. This isn’t completely necessary for a simple app such as this, but it’s good practice as you may want to share logic further if you are implementing other features such as Siri Shortcuts or iMessage apps.</p><p>// image here: caption: Architecture of London Underground app</p><p>Create a new framework in Xcode, go to File → New → Target… and select Framework. Some common product names for shared frameworks are “Core” or “Shared”. From now on, it’s easiest to create all new source files within this new shared framework target.</p><h3>Model</h3><p>We need to create a model to represent our data. Using Swift’s Codable protocol we can automatically decode the JSON response from the TfL API.</p><pre><code>public struct LineStatusUpdate: Identifiable, Decodable {
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case id
        case line = "name"
        case statuses = "lineStatuses"
    }
    public let id: String
    let line: Line
    let statuses: [StatusUpdate]
}
</code></pre><p>In order to keep our variable names “Swifty”, we can use coding keys to map from the response that the API returns:</p><pre><code>{
    id: "bakerloo",
    name: "Bakerloo",
    lineStatuses: [ ... ]
}
</code></pre><p>The full model used to build the app can be found in the sample code, linked at the bottom of this article.</p><h3>Networking</h3><p>We can implement a NetworkClient to handle our API calls. We will use URLSession from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation">Foundation</a> library to do this.</p><pre><code>import Foundation

public final class NetworkClient {
    private let session: URLSession = .shared

    enum NetworkError: Error {
        case noData
    }

    func executeRequest(request: URLRequest, completion: @escaping (Result&lt;Data, Error&gt;) -&gt; Void) {
        session.dataTask(with: request) { (data, response, error) in
            if let error = error {
                completion(.failure(error))
                return
            }
            guard let data = data else {
                completion(.failure(NetworkError.noData))
                return
            }
            completion(.success(data))
        }.resume()
    }
}
