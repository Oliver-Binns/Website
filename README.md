My personal website built using [Publish by John Sundell](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) (previously Wordpress).
When writing blog posts, I can now raise pull requests in Markdown format and they will be deployed automatically on merge.
This allows me to have friends review the pull requests for me and provide feedback in advance of publishing.

[![Generate Static Site](https://github.com/Oliver-Binns/Website/actions/workflows/swift.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Oliver-Binns/Website/actions/workflows/swift.yml)

Feel free to use any of the code yourself, or suggest improvements both for articles and the site design via issues and pull requests.
