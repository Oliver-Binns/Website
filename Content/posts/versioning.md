I recently created an open source Swift Package to help me automatically enforce versioning on my GitHub respositories using GitHub Actions. This post will go into detail about why versioning your code is important, how I built this to work automatically and why I chose to do this in Swift.

# Why version code?

Mobile apps becoming more complex resulting in larger codebases

Teams have been starting to look towards modular codebases in order to split up their code into manageable chunks

Sometimes we can create packages of code that are reusable across a wide range of different apps, we often call these libraries or SDKs.
