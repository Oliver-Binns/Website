title: A sceptic’s guide to Apple Vision Pro

Two months ago I made a decision I’ve been putting off for several years.
I had really wanted to make iPad my only personal device; the size is more in-keeping with my love for smaller devices and I'd been inspired to be more creative by [my friend Anna’s award-winning talk on using Swift Playgrounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfMmHiYi53Q).
iPad (especially iPad Pro) should be more than capable of performing any task (and more) that I would want to achieve.
I mean, it even contains the same M-series chips as the MacBook line-up.

In the end, I finally upgraded from my 2013 MacBook Air 11-inch to the new 2024 M3 13-inch model.

I have tried a few times to use Swift Playgrounds over Xcode when starting a new project.
Unfortunately it has always fallen just short of what I need it to be.
When building [my conferences app](https://github.com/Oliver-Binns/Conferences), I found it didn’t support support CloudKit.
When building [a musical party game app](https://github.com/Oliver-Binns/Crescendo), I found that it didn’t support MusicKit.
When exploring SwiftData during WWDC, I found that it wouldn’t support the new APIs until they were released later in the year.
This is all before the workarounds I’d need to make to ensure I could use Git, XCTest and other tools.

I’ve also tried to make more use of iPad in my work-life.
Basic functions like email work well, but I find it frustrating for more in-depth work such as creating slides.
It’s trickier to align objects and to create more complex transitions.
I find myself returning to my Mac to refine documents, even if I manage to create a first draft on iPad.

Perhaps it’s not too surprising then, that I approached Apple Vision Pro with a very sceptical mind.

Spending years working in big teams with millions of users, I had forgotten how to play and experiment with iOS development. When iPad playgrounds were released, I took the opportunity to play around. Thanks to the software's simplicity, I could re-ignite my creativity and - for the first time in years - not abandon my side projects.

# Hardware

Apple have always been great at designing hardware, so it didn’t surprise me that the Vision Pro is an incredibly impressive and visually stunning device.


Cameras: sometimes break the illusion for me, but only when I am focussing on real tasks, rather than virtual ones
minimal motion sickness

Battery- could be a lot better, but it’s detachable so you could always buy two?

# visionOS

windows stay where they are: I have found myself leaving things behind and being surprised when I return a few hours later

personas?

# Apps

Great demo apps
Really cool use-cases: 
immersive cinema (Disney+)
timers (not yet!)

# Summary

use-cases; location-based live activities

So far I am loving my new MacBook Air, but WWDC is in a few weeks; if Apple update Swift Playgrounds to add support for Swift Packages, unit tests and more, I will be kicking myself for not holding out just a little longer.
