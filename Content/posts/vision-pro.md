Two months ago I made a decision I’ve been putting off for several years.
I had really wanted to go iPad-only in my personal life; the size is more in-keeping with my love for smaller devices and I'd been inspired to be more creative by [my friend Anna’s award-winning talk on using Swift Playgrounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfMmHiYi53Q).
iPad (especially iPad Pro) should be more than capable of performing any task (and more) that I would want to achieve.
I mean, it even contains the same M-series chips as the MacBook line-up.

In the end, I finally upgraded from my 11" MacBook Air from 2013 to the new 13" M3 model.

I have tried a few times to use Swift Playgrounds over Xcode when starting a new project.
Unfortunately it has always fallen just short of what I need it to be.
When building [a musical party game app](https://github.com/Oliver-Binns/Crescendo), I found that it didn’t support MusicKit.

Spending years working in big teams with millions of users, I had forgotten how to play and experiment with iOS development. When iPad playgrounds were released, I took the opportunity to play around. Thanks to the software's simplicity, I could re-ignite my creativity and - for the first time in years - not abandon my side projects.

# Hardware

Cameras: break the illusion for me

# visionOS

# Apps

Great demo apps
Really cool use-cases: immersive cinema (Disney+), timers (not yet!)

# Summary

So far I am loving my new MacBook Air, but WWDC is in a few weeks; if Apple update Swift Playgrounds to add support for Swift Packages, unit tests and more, I will be kicking myself for not holding out just a little longer.
