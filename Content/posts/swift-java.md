## Inter-operability

Since its first release, Swift has had built-in interoperability for C, C++ and Objective-C.
This has made it a great candidate for migrating legacy codebases into a modern, memory safe and performant language. 
At the [ServerSide.swift conference](https://www.serversideswift.info) this year, Ben Cohen from Apple [announced Java interoperability with Swift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn6C_XEv1Mo).

Java (and other JVM-based languages, such as Kotlin or Scala) are popular, especially when running on non-Apple platforms.
This new interoperability gives us the ability to incrementally adopt Swift in codebases written using these languages.
We can checkout Appleâ€™s initial - working - implementation of Swift & Java interoperability today.
