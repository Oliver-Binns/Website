While users can often perform the same tasks with websites and native apps the use-cases for each are distinct and well-defined. Websites can be accessed from almost any device without an installation and provide the user with a wide range of information and tasks. Apps are usually much more tailored to the platform they will run on with deep system integration, require installation and usually allow the user perform a single or small group of related tasks.

Enter App Clips in iOS 14. App Clips bridge the gap between the web and native apps by removing the need to install before performing quick tasks.
