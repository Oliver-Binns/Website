I recently [posted on Twitter](https://x.com/oliver_binns/status/1712736226447409264?s=46) about how we’re restructuring our teams from a separate mobile and backend team into cross-disciplinary feature teams. In this blog post I am going to explain our aims as we undertake this change, some of the issues we are trying address and even some of the challenges we’re think we will face and how we’re planning to mitigate them. 

## Current Problems

A majority of the work we do revolves around changes that require input from multiple disciplines.
This is true of both new work and maintenance. 
When we build a new feature in our mobile app, we do the work for both iOS and Android.
Often this will require new backend APIs to be built and, since our infrastructure is written in code, sometimes these will even require help from AWS platform specialists.
When each of these different specialisms sit in different teams, it requires a lot of upfront planning to ensure dependencies are met in the correct order, and if anything goes wrong we would have to replan multiple teams’ roadmaps.

The platform team contains a tech lead and platform developers.](../../Images/team-restructure-before.png)
*Our Old Team Structure — Teams are split by discipline*

When there are more members of each specialism (i.e. Android developers) in a larger mobile team, we try and give them unrelated pieces of work to avoid merge conflicts in the code that is being written.
This means there are multiple features or pieces of work being delivered in parallel by the team.
Unless we clearly assign team members to a particular feature, this can result in a lot of communication overheads and redundancy.
For example, the whole team often end up invited to meetings for **every single** feature when only a single developer is needed to provide guidance.

Alternatively, it may be the team lead or a single individual that takes on the responsibility in all meetings, which results in a very top-down hierarchy where the team as a whole does not feel empowered.
What’s more, this can result in expert overload where this team lead accumulates more knowledge because they are at the centre of everything, resulting in them becoming indispensable in many situations.
This is a vicious cycle because as their presence is now vital, they will gain even more knowledge — until they burn out and the team comes to a standstill.

While agile principles state that business people and developers must work together daily, our old team structure did not encourage this behaviour.
Since product managers and business analysts did not sit inside our teams, they were not required to attend our regular scrum ceremonies including the daily stand-up.
We also encountered the similar communication barriers here, where it was not always clear which product manager or business analyst was responsible for a given feature.

Finally, since all our team members were constantly context switching between different features, it was difficult for them to focus for long enough to gain a deep understanding of each of one. This has an impact throughout our entire development lifecycle.

Starting at the design phase we saw the [Law of triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) begin to take effect because of the team’s lack of detailed knowledge of the feature.
This is more colloquially known as ‘bikeshedding’ from the example where stakeholders in a nuclear power-plant don’t understand enough detail about the important aspects of the plant, such as the nuclear reactor, but can easily spend time discussing the bikeshed.
In our case, it has resulted in ancillary functionality such as localisation being discussed far more than the core user experience.

As we progressed into the development phase..

Finally, once development was complete, we felt pressure to move straight onto the other ongoing parallel piece of work.
This meant that completed work was deployed and neglected with any monitoring and necessary iteration becoming low priority at the bottom of the team's backlog.

## Our Aims

*Our New Team Structure — Teams are split by business domain*

When restructuring our teams, we wanted to solve as many of these irritations as possible.
We created each of our teams around an end-to-end component of our app, with full ownership of their component.
We have drawn the lines between the teams responsibilities with the aim of minimising cross-team dependencies.
We wanted to ensure they have all skills to be able to successfully manage this _within_ the team, including making day-to-day decisions on maintenance and any enhancements.
We’re hoping that this will enable the team to have a full understanding of their area and current work without being distracted by work going on in other parts of the app.
Our leadership team should be an escalation path for the team to use at their discretion when problems arise.
They are not there to micromanage the team or step in to make decisions on the team’s behalf.

## Things we want to avoid

Spreading members of each specialism across multiple teams could result in these people becoming isolated and not feeling sufficiently supported in their work.
We’re aware that some of our less experienced developers are now the most senior developer of their particular specialism in their respective teams.
We’ve attempted to mitigate this by putting them alongside a more experienced developer from another specialism.
As part of this, we’re encouraging our senior developers to have a basic knowledge of the whole stack, not just their own code – after all general engineering principles should carry across these specialisms.

While we want to keep as much of our work within our team silos, we know that there will be occasions where our people will want advice and support from others in their specialism.
We’re encouraging our teams to keep their regular specialism specific catch-up calls to help maintain the cross-team relationships that we're carrying over from our previous teams.
We don’t want to go much further than this and over-define any inter-team ways of working preferring to follow the Agile Manifesto and trust individuals and interactions over processes.

Our teams have raised concerns about loss of responsibility

## Opportunities

We think our new multi-disciplinary teams should provide a range of new opportunities to our team members.

Those interested in pursuing their technical development will have more opportunities to work more closely with other disciplines and learn a new programming language or technology stack. They will also have more opportunities to define their work more closely: now the teams have the ability to work independently, they have the freedom to decide how to deliver a requirement for themselves.
 
More leadership opportunities for our team: delegating responsibility into the team. Discipline leadership opportunities.

## The Future

It’s actually been over a year since we first discussed our aspiration for multi-discipline teams.

We’ve put a lot of thought into this and overall we think this is going to be a huge improvement to the way our teams work. We’ve spent a lot of time ensuring that the responsibilities of each of our teams is both well defined and well communicated. We’ve worked hard to train our team to the point where everyone is comfortable and able to take on their new roles and responsibilities.

We’re certainly not complacent so we’ll be keeping a close eye out for feedback from our teams in their retros, and work to address any problems.
