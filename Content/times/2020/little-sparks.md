# Tech Lead
## Little Sparks Hospital
### Jun 2018 â€” Sep 2020

At Little Sparks Hospital, I was responsible for rebuilding the Little Journey app from the ground up using native technologies for iOS (UIKit, SceneKit, SpriteKit, Lottie) and Android (AndroidX, Lottie, Unity). I also built a bespoke backend for the Little Journey app, using the Vapor server-side Swift framework, which allows us to edit in-app content dynamically.
