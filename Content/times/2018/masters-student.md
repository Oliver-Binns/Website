I studied a wide-range of topics through out my degree including both hardware and software. More recently I have been studying a large amount of AI modules including neural networks and evolutionary computing. Alongside modules in Functional Programming, Software Testing and Model-Based Engineering, this year I will be completing my dissertation on using General Purpose GPU programming to enhance an existing biological simulation of immune system development.
