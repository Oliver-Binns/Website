# Film Coordinator
## York Student Cinema
### Nov 2016 — Jun 2018

As Film Coordinator at York Student Cinema, I was responsible for arranging the film schedule and liaising with the distributer was able to deliver films on time for the 4K Cinema projector. I also planned and managed a number of immersive film events, including for Paddington 2 which won the award for Best Event at the YUSU Media Awards. 

At the event, cinemagoers were submerged into the film right from their purchase of a “plane ticket” from Darkest Peru to York Student Cinema. A collaboration with SocieTEA provided “travellers” with a fantastic tea-tasting experience before the screening. This partnership gave SocieTEA exposure to YSC members and also produced an increased turnout at the cinema. The event also saw the cinema decorated with union flags and London Underground signage including the iconic “Quote of the Day”. Finally, attendees had the opportunity to indulge in Paddington’s favourite snack, marmalade sandwiches.
