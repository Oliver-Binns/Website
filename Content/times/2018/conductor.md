# Conductor
## Vanbrugh Chamber Choir
### Sep 2017 â€” Jun 2018

Throughout my final year at the University of York, I co-conducted the Vanbrugh College Chamber Choir alongside [Sam Gavin-Pitt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-gavin-pitt-5437601b1).\
The choir performed several concerts during the year, including at the college's 50th anniversary celebration weekend.
