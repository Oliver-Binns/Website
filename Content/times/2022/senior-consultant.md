# Senior Consultant
## Deloitte Digital
### Sep 2020 â€” May 2022


As a Senior iOS Developer I led teams of developers on enterprise projects for a number of high-profile clients across the public and private sectors, including the NHS Test and Trace programme. 

Outside of project roles, I am the Apple Alliance Development Lead for Deloitte North and South Europe. In this role I have been responsible for facilitating the learning of our internal development community and working with our Alliance contacts at Apple to communicate the latest platform changes to our clients.
