# Full-stack developer
## Amadeus
### Sep 2018 — Aug 2019

In September 2018, I returned to Amadeus as a full time developer. I worked in the Data Migration team, a full stack development team working using the Scrum agile methodology to produce software using C++, Java, Angular and Python. Our aim to facilitate the transfer of new customers' PNRs, eTickets and Frequent Flyer Profiles onto the Altéa Suite, ensuring zero-downtime for travellers. 

In February 2019, I joined another project working to create an iOS application written in Swift in close partnership with a major European airline.
