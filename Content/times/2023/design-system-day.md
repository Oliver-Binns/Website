# Speaker
## Design System Day
### Oct 2023


We talked about the design system we created for GDS’s first mobile app: GOV.UK ID Check. We covered our work to adapt the GOV.UK Design System for web into a native mobile world, taking guidance from Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines, Google’s Material Design Guidelines and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
