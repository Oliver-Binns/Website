Spoke at plSwift about "Scaling Mobile during a Global Pandemic". While the UK was in the grip of the unprecedented global COVID-19 crisis, we developed and ran a suite of apps deployed across 12,000 centrally managed iPhones to increase testing capacity x100, while also reducing wait times for results.

Oliver spoke about the technical details of how these apps were built and how we managed technical debt.
