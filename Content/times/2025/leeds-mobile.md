## Leeds Mobile
### June 2025

Presented a talk titled “Building the Foundations” at [Leeds Mobile](https://www.leedsmobile.com/past-talks#h.fabjtk8799vy).

It’s widely reported that Apple are late to the AI party. But are they really? And does it even matter? Let’s dive into what we can achieve with the new Foundation Models API, what’s still missing and most importantly how we can best draw on it to really help our users.
