# Company Secretary
## cloud-nine
### Sep 2011 — Jun 2012

I started a Young Enterprise company along with several other students from my Sixth Form college. The company was aimed at reducing the large amount of time that small children spend on computers and increasing motor skills and creativity. At the West Yorkshire Young Enterprise Final in May 2012, cloud-nine was awarded for Best Report and Accounts and Innovation and Enterprise. At the national Young Enterprise Final, cloud-nine was awarded the Human Networking Award for the best use of IT, sponsored by Cisco. 

As Company Secretary, I was mainly responsible for taking minutes during board meetings, but also organised the creation of our end of year Company Report. As an IT Consultant, I was responsible for the creation and maintenance of the company’s website and various other graphic design aspects, including transforming the company’s own typeface from a paper sketch to a final true-type font. 

Throughout the year I was part of a sales team on our trade-stand at various high-profile shopping centres including The Corn Exchange, Leeds and The McArthurGlen Designer Outlet, York, where we won the award for Best Sales Team.
