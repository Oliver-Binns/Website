# WWDC Scholar
## Apple Developer Programme
### May 2016

I was awarded a scholarship by Apple to attend their annual developer conference (WWDC) in San Francisco this June. The scholarship requirement was to make an app in Swift for any Apple Platform, demonstrating creative use of Apple technologies. This year I submitted my new app, Sunscreen, available on the app store which demonstrates integration with Apple's HealthKit, Safari View Controller, push notifications and more.
