## York Colleges
### Aug 2015 â€” Sep 2017

York Colleges is the follow up from the Vanbrugh College app from September 2014. I currently have 4 out of 9 colleges at York involved, so there is still plenty of room for expansion. The app is currently available on Android, iOS and the Web. 

The colleges have a back end admin panel so that they can edit their own data with regards to events, contacts and FAQs.
