# W/W (Waiter)
## TGI Fridays
### Aug 2012 â€” Apr 2015

While working as a waiter, I developed strong interpersonal skills as I regularly had to identify guest needs, adapting my service style for each table in order to make every individual leave the restaurant happy. 

I demonstrated my ability to work independently and multitask in busy environments while not losing sight of the fact I am part of a team, noticing when colleagues were out of their depth and helping out accordingly.
