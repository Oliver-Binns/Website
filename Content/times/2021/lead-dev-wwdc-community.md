# Lead Developer
## wwdc.community
### Apr â€” Jun 2021

As Web Lead for WWDC Community Week, I oversaw a team of developers to create the website for a major iOS community conference which coincided with the official annual Apple Worldwide Developer Conference. The website was built in React.js using Firebase and AirTable for authentication and data storage.


Under strict timelines, we were able to use agile development principles with an automated continuous integration and delivery strategy to support one of the most wide-ranging iOS community events of the year.
